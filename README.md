Monster Typer
-------------

## Overview 

The problem we set out to face is to encourage typing and increase productivity. The method select for this was a game loosely based off pet/minion training games. The code was distributed into sections that record keystrokes, process them into words, then reward points to the player according to word size. The program results in users having an enjoyable experience growing their monster while they are typing. This project will increase the incentive to type by providing the user with a fun environment that bases its rewards on words typed. 

## Using the System

The home page shows your monster and the current level which you are on. 
You also have the option to click on your monster to increase its friendship with you.
The stats page gives you a detailed report of your monsters stats which include:
* Monster Name 
* XP (experience points) 
* HP (health points)
* Features like personality and relationship status
* Battles won


The fight page is not yet completed but will be completed in the future.

## How to use the Key Logger

The key logger automatically activates whenever and wherever you type. This could be a google search, a word document, or even a discord message for example. 
This means that there is no need to have the GUI displayed on screen while you type. It is intended that the application be minimized while you are typing creating less distraction.
